#### ARCHIVIST

Rusty Quill presents

#### ARCHIVIST

_(simult.)_ The Magnus Archives.

#### ALEX, LYDIA, MIKE

_(simult.) (ominously)_ The Magnus Archives.

#### [LYDIA CACKLES]

#### ALEX

_(muffled)_ You're the worst.

Right, hello and welcome to our assistant special of The Magnus Archives. We're in our season break at the moment and we thought we would take the time and catch up with some of the assistants for the archive 'cause we all listen to a certain Jonathan Sims... rather a lot

#### ALEX

_(simult.) on Magnus Archives

#### MIKE

_(simult.) (chuckles)_

#### LYDIA

_(simult.) (chuckles, agrees)_

#### ALEX

so I thought we might spend some time with people other than Jonny. With that in mind, who have I got with me today?

#### MIKE

We got Mike, who plays Tim Stoker,

#### ALEX

and

#### LYDIA

and Lydia, who plays Melanie.

#### ALEX

So first things first then, obviously you play Tim, Mike; you play Melanie, Lydia; 

#### LYDIA

Well done. Yep, that's it.

#### [MIKE AGREES]

#### ALEX

and I play Martin

#### LYDIA

_(simult.)_ Yep.

#### MIKE

_(simult.)_ It's hard remembering.

#### LYDIA

Good job there.

#### ALEX

So, what do you actually think about your own characters?

#### [LYDIA LAUGHS]

#### MIKE

Argh, I knew the heavy stuff was gonna come out first. 

#### LYDIA

_(in faux despair)_ No.

#### ALEX

I'm happy to lead the charge and say: whilst Martin's lovely, I think he'd drive me completely up the wall.

#### LYDIA 

_(simult.) (laughs, agrees)_

#### MIKE

_(simult.) (laughs)_

#### ALEX

I think I'd be- I'd be like: no you're lovely, stop. No Ma-, stop. Stop. Just- just go- go visit pets at home and stroke some animals for a while Martin and you'll feel better.

#### LYDIA 

_(simult.) (laughs, agrees)_

#### MIKE

_(simult.) (laughs)_

#### ALEX

But for- for the rest of you, how- what- what are your actual takeaways of the characters that you play?

#### MIKE

Well, uh, go on then, I'll go next. So my- my character, I've always found, well, since season two I've found a bit of a struggle. Mostly because he started off very happy-go-lucky and sort of, you know, very lively, very chipper and then... uh yeah, well, without- am I allowed to give spoilers?

#### ALEX

Yeah, you are. Yeah.

#### MIKE

Amazing. Well, towards the end of season two, uh, everything kind of goes to pot and Tim becomes horrendously depressed. Um, to the point where my character was the polar opposite of what I was originally brought on to do.

#### LYDIA

_(laughs)_ It's bait and switch really.

#### MIKE

Yeah, it literally was the best bait and switch.

#### ALEX

I think it worked really well.

#### MIKE

I- I-, don't get me wrong, I enjoy it. I do really enjoy it. It gives me a moment of quiet contemplation so I can consider my life decisions at least once a month. But like, at the same time, I- if I were to meet Tim? I'd just slap him.

#### [ALEX AND LYDIA LAUGH]

#### ALEX

He- he-

#### MIKE

A full back hand as well. _(??? i have apd)_, everything.

#### ALEX

He's had a rough- He's had a rough time of it.

#### MIKE

He has had a _very_ rough time of it.

#### ALEX

He's had a very rough time of it.

#### MIKE

But come on.

#### ALEX

But look at his support network.

#### MIKE

Yeah, or

#### ALEX

lack thereof.

#### MIKE

Lack thereof, yeah. I think that that is the main problem- is that there is no predefined support network for Tim. He- he needs like _something_

#### ALEX

_(in background)_ Anything

#### MIKE

to pull him out

#### ALEX

Anyone.

#### MIKE

and after that happens- if that happens, it- things will probably get better for Tim. But hey, we'll have to see.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, it's a horror podcast; I'm sure that-

#### ALEX

everything will be fine, yeah

#### LYDIA

getting a, yeah, wonderful support network 

#### MIKE

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

and the tools to

#### MIKE

Yeah, yeah.

#### LYDIA

work through his traumas and lots of hugs and puppies is exactly what's gonna happen.

#### MIKE

Well the thing is, they'll be readily available but never accessible.

#### [ALEX, LYDIA AND MIKE LAUGH]

#### LYDIA

Tantalus' support network.

#### [ALEX AND MIKE LAUGH]

#### ALEX

Well that's- that's still brighter than I- what I was thinking. The tools to deal with your problems in the Magnus universe generally consist of some kind of book or like a gun... 

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### MIKE

Yeah.

#### ALEX

or a knife... or fire. Fire's a good one.

#### MIKE

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Being oblivious seems to be the only power.

#### ALEX

You know what? You know what? So far, yeah.

#### MIKE

Yeah.

#### ALEX

Being completely oblivious, there's- theres your solution.

#### LYDIA AND MIKE

Yeah.

#### ALEX

How about you Lydia? Playing Melanie, how have you been finding it? How do you- what do you think of your character?

#### LYDIA

Like, I'd still want to know why and how she was shot by a ghost.

#### ALEX

_(slightly frantic)_ I want to know that too!

#### [MIKE LAUGHING]

#### LYDIA

Like, I. don't. know! Right, that-

#### ALEX

None of us do.

#### MIKE

None of us do.

#### ALEX

Like genuinely, the only person-

#### LYDIA

that wanker Jonny, will not- well, he won't tell me.

#### ALEX

The only person who knows is Jonny, and he has abjectly refused to tell us.

#### LYDIA

_(calmly)_ Eh, it's um, it's a little frustrating.

#### [ALEX AND MIKE LAUGH]

#### LYDIA

Uh-

#### ALEX

It's only a major defining character moment that drove you back towards the Magnus Archives, ok. Calm down.

#### LYDIA

Aargh!

#### MIKE

Yeah, exactly. It's not like you need to know what your motivations are.

#### [LYDIA AND MIKE LAUGH]

#### LYDIA

Right, so I started out- obviously, I started later than you two and, uh, came in; I thought it was probably gonna be for a one-off, early on, and, uh, the only characteristic that I gave her, really, was the- it was- you know, how far is the rod up her ass on any particular given day? Um, and since then I've sort of developed that into, well, she- it's very important to her that she seems competent

#### ALEX

Yes.

#### LYDIA

and she seems to lash out the moment that she doesn't really know what's going on; or that she thinks other people think she doesn't know what's going on. Um, and s- so yeah, that's the- the one way you could hurt her the most. 

#### [MIKE CHUCKLES]

#### LYDIA

Just probably like- yeah, I think probably her- her ideal torture would be something like The Spiral where it's like she's given a test and she hasn't studied for it.

#### [ALEX LAUGHS]

#### MIKE

Or potentially like IKEA furniture, when she's the only one and doesn't have a handbook.

#### LYDIA

_(simult.) (laughs, agrees)_

#### MIKE

_(simult.) (laughs)_

#### LYDIA

Or like the Allen key doesn't quite fit.

#### MIKE

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### ALEX

But there's other people doing it, who do have all the bits

#### MIKE

Yeah. 

#### ALEX

and are doing really well.

#### MIKE

Yeah, yeah.

#### LYDIA

And it's fine. Right?

#### MIKE

And everything's ok.

#### LYDIA

Yeah. So why is it-

#### ALEX

And they keep offering to help.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### [MIKE LAUGHS]

#### [LYDIA GROWLS LIKE THE HULK]

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### ALEX

_(slightly annoyed)_ If I wanted help I'd ask for it.

#### LYDIA

Exactly, exactly.

#### [MIKE LAUGHS]

#### MIKE

Non-branded He-Man smash green things smash, right?

#### LYDIA

Smash smash anger, yes.

#### MIKE

Smash anger.

#### LYDIA

Um, yeah. So, she's still got some cheer in her, which is ridiculous. I think the last time that I played her, she was inviting Martin to the pub.

#### ALEX

Yes.

#### LYDIA

So...

#### ALEX

Yes.

#### LYDIA

There's actually some- some happiness, which is obviously a cruelty.

#### [ALEX, THEN MIKE LAUGH]

#### ALEX

Playing the character- so we- obviously, we know like what you think about them and stuff like that. But when it comes to actually playing the characters, obviously like, for all of us, these aren't us. Like they're really, really not us as people.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, I mean like-

#### [ALEX AND MIKE LAUGH]

#### LYDIA

Tumblr, Tumblr you would have absolutely no sympathy with Alex in real life.

#### [ALEX AND MIKE LAUGH]

#### ALEX

I'm horrible

#### [MIKE LAUGHING IN BACKGROUND]

#### LYDIA

Right? He's- he's awful. No kittens for Alex.

#### ALEX

But, in all seriousness,

#### [MIKE HAS ONE QUIET WHEEZE-LAUGH]

#### ALEX

obviously like, you- you have to have an 'in'. You have to have an 'in' for your character. You have to have a way to get in and actually like portray that. So I'm curious 'cause... Mike, starting with you, you've had the most change. Because you're 'in', initially when we were sort of going over character stuff, was very much, yeah, that positivity and it was that- it was almost like if The Magnus Archives needed to have a PR face.

#### MIKE

_(laughs)_ Yeah.

#### ALEX

Like it'd be Mike. You know, _(upbeat)_ 'Come join The Magnus Archives'.

#### MIKE

Yeah, the person who-

#### LYDIA

_(laughs)_ Yeah.

#### ALEX

_(still upbeat)_ 'We've got books.'

#### [LYDIA LAUGHS]

#### MIKE

Yeah, who does the finger guns and everything. Like, points and, _(upbeat)_'Yeah!', you know, we just- _(upbeat)_'Look at our merch. We've got merch. Have you heard about the merch?' Yeah.

#### ALEX

And most of the characterization for that just consisted of reining it in a bit.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### MIKE

Yeah, exactly, um-

#### ALEX

But now that's kind of gone. So what's your 'in' now? Because, I'd actually say that you're getting really good at just switching, as a character, Tim, on and off.

#### MIKE

Well, I feel- I mean this is a horror podcast but I feel like I'm gonna bring the tone down now. So basically in the season one stuff, like you say, it was very- it was very easy for me because my- my character, outside of the character, is very, I feel, is very lively and bubbly and if you saw the- the Christmas livestream then that- that basically is who we are as, you know, as people. Um, and having to make that switch around season two was very, very difficult.

#### ALEX

That was tough.

#### MIKE

To the beginning- for the beginning of it, literally you know- you guys probably don't know, who are listening - but we have show notes at the- at the- in the middle and at the end of everything that we do and Alex sits through and takes us through a couple of his thoughts and we discuss ideas about how we could have played that scene differently or better or whatever.

#### ALEX

It's- it's almost like respecting your actors but- but not.

#### MIKE

Yeah, exactly, yeah.

#### [LYDIA LAUGHS]

#### MIKE

Al-almost like giving a helping hand but it- if the helping hand is also a whoopee cushion.

#### LYDIA

_(laughingly)_ Hah.

#### MIKE

So what we actually- what we ended up doing, Alex and I, during the beginning few times was that we'd sit down and Alex would be like, 'You have to be, less,, of that.' 

#### [ALEX, LYDIA AND MIKE LAUGH]

#### ALEX

It- it was just, yeah, I think-

#### LYDIA

Have. less. fun.

#### MIKE

Yeah.

#### ALEX

I think you were thrown by just how hard a change the character had to go through.

#### MIKE

Massively.

#### ALEX

because at first it was very much like okay so you want it still to be sort of like Tim just maybe a little bit sedate and it was like no no, no no. this is like 

broken individual

completely broken there is nothing left

has no hope left about anything and that in the beginning was very difficult but now if going back to the original question my 'in' to getting there is actually to think about _everything_ in my life that has gone wrong

lydia then alex laugh painfully/pityingly

all at once 

yeah pretty much

and then that is how I hit the tone of Tim when I come into the recording studio 

but- but that makes sense's because I mean from Tim like the way we were discussing it as a character was like we only really started making progress when we realized it was best to just you are not playing Tim anymore 

no 

you're playing another person who is still called Tim almost like because it was just yeah we had to take it right back down to zero 

I mean like you said it's very much a case of 

we had to go back beyond zero I feel to kind of get to where I am with Tim now because I have to remove everything from my mind that was what Tim was in season one and know that that character is still there underneath everything else

sure 

i mean as someone who listens it feels like there's still there's still like the shape of the character there because it's coming out now and very dry hue

yeah
yeah yeah

and what's sort of clever about it is it's not an empowered dry humor it's not a I'm laughing at what's happening to me it's just it's a really bitter dry humor

Lydia playing playing Melanie what's your what's your 'in' 'cause again I think we had a harder time with it at the start but you've gotten really good similarly it just of adopting that persona now 

so I am NOT a voice actor I I've done quite a lot of recorded stuff but it has always been me doing the work and I really struggle with a lot of kinds of performing because I- I essentially don't have a poker face and I've worked quite hard on a lot of things like improv skills and presentation skills so I'm

like you're very skilled speaker 

yeah 

yeah for sure

that's things I do as me and so it's actually quite strange I haven't actually acted as another character. in terms of like how the character themselves is, I tend to think of what is she doing work that she's proud of right now. so in the first thing where they're in the- the old hospital 

oh yeah 

the frustration is her job didn't work yes and she doesn't understand why 

yeah 

and so she's almo- but that's almost more of a problem than the the fear 

mm-hmm 

I saw this thing and I don't have the answer whereas 

mm

like she's she's the producer right like her whole character is that she's a producer she makes stuff happen and she makes stuff work and she knows people and she gets things to, um- and then in quite a few other things like all the things that have happened since there was something spun out and like where she went broke into that train carriage it's all very planned 

yeah 

she's a producer she works out how to do it. I had to do I had to go there there was a lot of security but I found a way in 

yeah yeah 

and then it all spirals out of control and so this is horrible for her. similarly that's why I actually think that she quite enjoyed the time that she read the statement of the guy in the bed because there she's doing her job at the end she's going through all the files and well, this is okay. this is a working day. and you know similarly I'm not gonna spoil it too specifically but you know there's a lot of things where there's a- okay here's a terrible threat to you- that someone's made a horrible threat what's the obvious solution? take out the threat.

laughs

like I actually was a bit annoyed that it was done so clumsily, but

laughter

there's a bit

we did have a big discussion about- well I mean if I was Melanie which I sort of am because I happen to know that what she's using wouldn't really work 

you know you think she's under a lot of pressure. um, but yeah so- and that's why I think that you know it makes sense for her to click with Becerra 

so yeah when it comes to playing Martin there's a bit of a weird juxtaposition there. because on the one hand I'd argue that he's been used earlier for a lot of the comedy. like again he was he's a foil he's a foil to the the dour archivist but on the flip side that isn't enough for a character so it meant that we've had to sort of dial up things other than just Oh Wacka Wacka Wacka how inept but part of that means that when it comes to playing Martin I basically looked back picked all of the things about myself that I left by the wayside in a younger version

lydia awwwwwwwwwww

and then just make that the entire person 

lydia aww, then mike aw mate

lydia my heart

no genuinely, like, this this is an _(insign??)_ to all of the worst bits of Alex about ten years ago

mike _(understanding noise)_ ah

but obviously the caring thing I mean that's a weakness of you like that nervousness obsession with trying to make things work and so on like I basically just hunted down a bunch of negative 

yeah, like, 

characteristics

yeah it's true that needing to fix everyone is definitely something that you

oh it's something that I 

it's so common and then you you do genuinely have to kind of like sometimes yeah Martin not everyone will like you all of the time 

and that's okay. that's okay

Martin is very much an eighteen year old. like that's what Martin- like I realized the character is not that

a good 18 year old, such a good 18 year old

but it is an 18 year old where someone older comes along goes listen one people are gonna hate you 

yeah 

two that's okay

yeah

and three, you can't fix everyone 

mike
you know exactly, yeah, he has the best of intention yeah so I like

and basically, that's me just hunting down for all of the hard lessons 

lydia
just want to give him a hug

alex
he doesn't need a hug. he needs to grow up. i did it, so can he.

do you know what? genuinely. genuinely when I listen to Martin on the Magnus archives, I just want to give him a hug

lydia 
_(mourningly)_ yeah

mike
and then I have to come in and play a character

lydia cackles

mikw
that snubs him

alex
that's just awful

mike
constantly

lydia cackling

mike
and i'm just like 'but i like you but i'm obliged to hate you'

lydia
contractually obliged to be a dick

alex
the narrative gods require me to- to ruin your life. Okay, so

lydia
is that what you want us to call you now

mike
the narrative gods

lydia
you and jonny. the- the-

alex
oh i didn't say it

lydia, mike laugh

alex
wait i did

mike
you kind of did, it's on- 

lydia
yeah you- you did we've literally got evidence

mike
it's on, everything now

alex
yeah twice

lydia laughs

alex
so what were your favorite character moments then so we've been sort of discussing a few specific examples in any type whether it was horror just good acting funny whatever for your character specifically what would you say are the bits that you actually like really enjoyed because certainly from my perspective I find it really hard to do that because for me it's always- I'm looking at the work. So I'm sat there going 'aw could've done that' 'aw I probably should have tweaked that' 'aw I could've improved that'. So I found it quite difficult to home in on 'I really enjoyed this'.

lydia
no i hate it. they're all _(??? i have apd)_

alex
fair fair

mike laughs

lydia
terrible,

mike
and

lydia
terrible experience, wouldn't do it again

mike
cut there, yeah

all three laugh

mike
that'll do right we're done, yeah? um _(laughs)_

all three laughing

lydia
off for chips

mike cheering yay, alex joins

mike
production (??? i have apd) um- well we started with me a few times do you wanna go first lyd?

lydia
um... no.

alex
I'm happy to go first if it's gonna say so there were few of mine that I liked I liked doing big and because doing the statements is a nice moment where you can kind of lay aside the character that you normally play and play sort of someone else and I'm

especially been enjoying them recently

because I'm it's almost like I'm not

doing the statement I'm doing an

impression of how Johnny would perform

this

Bateman Ryan I see mm so there's an

added layer to that which makes it quite

fun and quite interesting and from like

from a comedy perspective it I know a

lot of people it's cringe humor and I

personally hate fringe you the was

improvised so whilst the statement like

we had a couple of bullet points to here

and one of them was that that she's

under the impression that she's gonna

get paid but pulling out money and

paying for it was just off the cuff and

I entire tape that we finally used was

basically lower II desperately trying to

not react out of character as she's

crying with laughter suppressing it cuz

it came from like completely left field

so that was good fun because we got a

great take literally on the other side

of the microphone is I have her biting

her lips so it's quite nice I enjoyed

that I can't wait if there's offcuts of

that kind of lie I did enjoy that a lot

so my favorite would be I can t remember

which episode was but the first time I

came in and had an argument with Johnny

on yes so at that point you were still

quite early on in oh yeah yeah and news

does according under blankets

yeah yeah yeah yeah and the fact that so

me and Johnny have known each other ten

years and from the beginning that was

through comedy theater at University and

but we just could not keep a straight

face and well over an hour I got a long

time like five minutes eh yeah I can

believe it but but I mean that actually

means that the energy in the thing is

people that are frustrated were not

really well known tapered and that's

because like we're both looking at each

other

daring each other to crack up I think

there was like by the end of it there

was just like the complex web of in

jokes about the fact because the the

light on the corridor as well so so we

will record

under a blanket in Martin Martin and

Sarah's corridor and the light in the

hallway was disco at disco light yeah so

you're under a blanket

shouting each other and then you can

take it off while alex is reviewing the

sound and working out how to direct your

next tape and you're like and then you

just start dancing each other and trying

to wind each other up in as different

characters while also winding each other

up as real people it's a total roller

coaster ride don't miss the disco

corridor I loved that corridor yeah all

the time

every take so what was yours laughter

there are a few there are a few that

stick out I think one of my favorite

scenes to shoot was the one where Martin

and Tim and the backstory to this was

the the recording that we were doing at

that point was in the corner of a room

and so it was Martin and Tim running

away from not Sasha and then having to

run down corridors by the layers and

then pant and be out of threat in a

corner for about eight takes and that

was before we set the audio running so

that we would actually be out of breath

by the time I got to shoot everyone

likes the exciting episodes you know

where a lot happens as a way of breaking

it up I cannot stress enough there is no

better way to feel like a complete

pretending to have fights or pretending

to run like recording combats the worst

yeah makes you feel such an idiot boys

be good fun sprinting at a wall over and

we were actually jogging on the spot as

well like to try and get ourselves in

the mind of the character I mean the the

production level like quality level on

the Magnus and gaming I like I can say

it's absurdly high because I don't do

any of the work like it's Alex and his

team of extraordinary editors that do

that but it means that like the stuff

that they end up demanding of us in

order to produce the right Foley or the

right kind of attitude or the right you

get some very bizarre asks finishing up

them with a last bit of like how what is

your relationship with horror so you as

a person know your characters let's not

get like really meta with it or anything

but for each of you how are you engaging

with horror

how are you interacting with it even if

it's just I hate horror which I don't

think is the case for either of you but

nonetheless like how do you engage with

it as a genre so I have no interest in

being upset scared by media sure but I

have a long relationship with horror as

a thing to make and a thing that is that

has an interesting kind of commentary on

the world yes but like we were talking

earlier actually today about like the

British horror tradition which from

vertigo and Alan Moore and Karen Berger

which I see the Magnus archives as being

but it fits very nicely within that

tradition because very it's politically

aware clever psychological horror there

is of its time and reflects kind of

ideas and fears of the current kind of

era so yeah so we near earlier but like

the arc of swamp thing where it starts

out so yeah I b-movie type guy turns

into a comp off in a place they get

blown up

and the wife dies because motivation

that's what we're good for guys turns

into a compost heap and then wants to

like avenge because that's where we are

and it's pretty b-movie it is a good

b-movie but then Alan Moore comes in and

it changes like there's this incredible

kind of shift as it becomes a

about identity and bodies and psychology

and your own connection to the earth and

it has all those weird LSD sex scenes

see I'm for that specifically I was

always fascinated with because it was

allemaal that really dove into it the

whole he's fine unless you're afraid and

then the fear like hurts so then he gets

like aggressive like that's that was a

lovely way of exploring a lot of stuff

absolutely because shocker people who

work on the Magnus archives are

interested in the fear as a mechanism

and yeah so yeah I love horror as a

mechanism to talk about interesting

scary things it's good lens yeah but

I've got absolutely no interest in

watching horror films and getting

freaked out you know I find I find that

really interesting actually because

coming on board with the Magnus archives

was a massive step change for me yeah

because I don't know about all the

awesome writers that you guys know about

and I'm sort of starting to learn about

it because I'm interested you know and

I'm interested in Johnny's motivations

and Alex and Lidz motivations and all

the other guys on the cast as well and

for me I used to deal with comedy you

know my youtube channel was a comedy

channel and coming into the Magnus

archives are than editing it and you

know playing a character in it was just

the polar opposite of everything but

I've never known I was used to because

like you Lydia I don't there is some

horror that I enjoy watching but I don't

really enjoy being scared inverted

commas by by media and what-have-you you

know there's enough of that in the world

already so I'm very much of the opinion

that I prefer things that aren't horror

so then playing the character in a

horror podcast for me gives me that that

perspective of what would happen if

someone came in and they didn't have the

first idea about any of this law or you

know but yeah I mean obviously I know

about things like the eldritch horror I

mean you've got stuff like that you know

I'm familiar with it I've listened to a

few of the audiobooks now that was

introduced to me by by a friend of mine

and his brother and that was my entry

into a lot of the things that you I

think you guys have been thinking about

for a while

and some of the the sort of stuff that's

sitting in the background and I'm

actually learning about this stuff as

I'm going through playing the character

listening to the stories listening back

to everyone's work and yeah that's yeah

where I pitch in see how many people

weird one when it comes to horror

so shocker teenage boy likes horror stop

the presses yeah how weird I wa I know

this has never happened before never so

I was shocker I was a little bit of an

obsessive kid in certain ways and one of

them is if you introduced me to an

author

I'll read every single thing they ever

read and then I'll move on to the next

door I mean every single thing they ever

read and move on and so on

yeah but for me with horror I'm a little

bit broken in that I've genuinely never

found any piece of horror media that's

really or very rarely at least found

anything that actually has an effect on

me I don't get that kind of emotional

response it just doesn't really work for

me yeah but I've engaged with horror or

lots both like writing myself or in

making like it's been a while like film

and so on but I'd say my main in has

been sort of cinema and so on but for a

lot of it comes down to horror is an

excellent technical example for working

in fiction oh yeah there's a reason that

if you are starting a new production

company or you're trying to break into

film yeah almost everyone makes horror

yeah and there's a reason for it and

it's that it has a lot of very very

clearly codified tropes trend and

techniques yeah you know if you want to

do horror oh is your character is your

character feeling psychologically

unbalanced chucking a Dutch angle in

there rotate the camera by about you

know 25 degrees and then maybe do a tilt

shift to mess around with like some

distances and so on but I think horror

is one of the genres more than any other

where it allows technique to shine

absolutely because if you are bad it

does not matter how good your monster is

or how good your conceit is your thing

will be garbage yeah exactly it's

peculiar in that everyone always goes to

horror because they know horror best but

it's also a lot of ways the least

forgiving I think comedy and horror

actually have quite a lot in common

yeah they're all about you you have to

be playing with the audience's energy

you have to be exactly aware of where

they are on any kind of park yeah yeah

break the tension at exactly the right

point so I think the father most of us

of the wider team knew each other

through comedy and we're trained in

comedy like comedy is the hard I think

is the hardest thing to do well yeah I

and to do really well and that means

that you're you and you I think in many

ways you have to lose your ego to be

good at it because you have to be

willing to mess up in the most

embarrassing ways like yeah yeah first

hundred five minutes and an open mic

night are going to be horrendous yep and

that allows you to then play with energy

and timing we've got a draw to a close I

think we've had a lot of discussion I

know we'd like to go into stuff in some

more detail but you know tight time is a

thing that we have to factor so what I

would ask then is what if you had to

recommend one piece of horror for

listeners not necessarily like you loved

the Magnus archives so you will like

this but something more like if you want

to know horror you should try this I

think already this podcast but reading

that early vertigo stuff that British

psychological horror twist and there's

only you you probably only need to get

through a bunch of like you know maybe

100 rather short comics it can be read

in a relatively short period of time and

you begin to see this you see this whole

world change and I think it's a really

interesting direction shift that changed

a lot of horror that came after it but

I'm not expert so it could well be that

other people be like no this other

writer came well before but reading

through the early Swamp Thing and then

how that exploded into Sandman and help

laser and a lot of other like related

characters was super valuable to me I

thought you might so from the way that

I've engaged with horror I guess they're

like Lydia said there are lots of

different styles and there are lots of

different elements but if you want a

pure in my opinion kind of

spective on different kinds of horror

that exist within one place or one

universe of one thing alien isolation is

a fantastic way to get into it because

having having a thing about other gaming

titles there are a lot of gaming titles

like dead space and things like that

which give you weaponry to be able to

deal with whatever threat is coming

after you know which is its horror but

it's a once removed kind of it because

you know that the threat is always at

arm's reach if you need it to be unless

that's taken away from you and in alien

isolation it is there is a constant

threat and it will never go away and it

follows you throughout the entire game

I'm generally too terrified by the very

concept to think about picking

examination of detention yeah well not

just tension though I'd say it's more

than that building on your point is that

it's tension but it's also the

subjugation of an individual within a

tense environment and there are points

where you have weaponry but you still

can't do anything to get rid of the main

threat so you know and then there are

other elements as well like you know

stealth bits and you know there's things

in the it's a really good example of

taking those those important bits that

we think in like Western horror

especially in horror sci-fi obviously

yeah obviously because it has to turn

them into mechanics yeah highlights them

in a really interesting way yeah so it

does like if you go into it with a

critical eye yeah like trying to like

engage yourself and learn you can learn

a lot just by playing that game by going

oh I see what you're doing with the

music yeah yeah look at how you've set

this space out to focus on I see yeah

it's a good demonstration if you choose

to interpret it that way and you know

what as well for those of you who aren't

aren't gamers and are listening to this

if you want a get in I would recommend

the film version of 2001 Space Odyssey

yeah definitely because well it has it

has a total removal of power that then

becomes horrifying but if you haven't

seen our won't spoil oh yeah it's been

it's been not that long since it was

originally released

so yeah I agree with you me I worked

really hard to make sure I read that in

the year 2000 basically a child when so

my recommendation is gonna be a bit

generic but it comes with an addendum

which is I recommend reading a random

selection of lovecraft but with a very

very key consideration which is ya love

crafted a lot for cosmic horror and so

on but the guy was really problematic

another really really problem for his

time as well yeah boy his tie is he was

a ticket for his tie is easy to read his

stuff and go well you know it's the past

I think no no no like even at the time

he was extremely problematic author but

what I would say is if you choose to

engage with it critically and again this

is me the soulless robot man who's

always concerned with the how if you

actually really dig into it and you want

to wrap your head around horror it's a

good way for you to read it and go I see

what should have been different there or

I see how this could be problematic and

there's a very important aspect with

horror that people forget especially on

the creation side which is when you make

something you are telling people

something you are not just telling a

story you are telling someone everything

everything that you make has a message

yeah and sometimes that message can

either be not what you thought or can be

the opposite yeah if you don't want to

tell a story about a strong female

character in bunny ears except at the

end of it all the audience thinks is Wow

that was a really flat one-dimensional

character congratulations your message

is almost certainly not what you hope to

know and love craft is a really great

one to dig into especially the Innsmouth

fish people one as one of the examples

where it's like interesting I get I get

the horror and I get why it's scary and

this bit side to take but it's a really

good example of something that you can

read and you can't just go oh yes that

was brilliant job done you have to

engage with it and you have to go okay

if you were wanting to make something as

horror as this yeah it's do you leave

behind what bits are not appropriate

what bits do not fit our modern world or

even let's be frank the world that is

but it's just it's very easy to read

passively and it's very easy to watch

something go

that was scary therefore it was good for

her I'm inclined to agree having very

recently been introduced to the actual

the written version and the audio

version of I think it was what's it the

Dunwich horror yes the don't which how

are ya the Dunwich horror I've recently

heard the audio version of that and

having listened to it for the first time

I totally agree yeah totally you can

literally see the point's where you can

go ah right yeah so I think we will wrap

up there yes we're gonna have to put a

reading list on these we will we will

put together a reading list so that it's

things that we think that you should

probably give a goat apart from that I

think that we're done here I think we've

covered the systems thanks for coming

and thanks so much for listening and

thanks for bearing with us over the

season break next week we should be

returning to our previously scheduled

programming exciting science I mean I'm

very much them I just decide to hold off

the cliffhanger for another six months

just really is yeah but yeah major angle

off of there so thanks for me and thanks

my for one else
